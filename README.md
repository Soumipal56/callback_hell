1. Create a function afterDelay
Requirements:
This function will take two things:
time (in milliseconds), a callback function
After the given time, it should call the callback
Inside the callback, "Callback executed" should be printed

2. Create a getUser function that takes a username and returns (after 1 second) an object with id and username, then call getUserPosts, which (after 1 second) returns a posts array.
Final output: Print the username first, then the posts.

3. Create three functions: loginUser (returns a user after 1 sec), fetchPermissions (returns permissions after 1 sec), and loadDashboard (returns “Dashboard loaded” after 1 sec). Call them in sequence: first loginUser, then inside it fetchPermissions, then loadDashboard, and finally print the result.

4. getProduct → getPrice → applyDiscount
getProduct(id) → after 1 sec return { id, name }
Then call getPrice(productId) → returns price
Then applyDiscount(price) → returns final discounted price
Output: Print discounted price.
