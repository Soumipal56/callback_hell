1. Create a function afterDelay
Requirements:
This function will take two things:
time (in milliseconds), a callback function
After the given time, it should call the callback
Inside the callback, "Callback executed" should be printed

2. Create a getUser function that takes a username and returns (after 1 second) an object with id and username, then call getUserPosts, which (after 1 second) returns a posts array.
Final output: Print the username first, then the posts.
